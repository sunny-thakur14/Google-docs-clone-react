# Google-docs-clone-react
This is a google doc clone created using react and nodesjs.
You can see the whole project at http://localhost:3000/

I have used quill as text editor , react for front end and nodejs for backend.
Database is mongodb here.

In backend i have used socket.io to create and receive client requests.


Front end is hosted at netlify https://googledoc1.netlify.app/
Backend is hosted at render.com
